# Tic-Tac-Toe-JS
## How it's played?
It is  is a classic game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. The app lets you choose the number of human players (1 or 2) and then asks for names for the players. If you choose only one player, the other one will be the computer, who will make random moves. At the end you can choose to play again. The score is registered automatically.
